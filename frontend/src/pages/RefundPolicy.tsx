      <h1>Refund and Return Policy</h1>
      <p>
        Our services are digital and strategy-based. We invest considerable resources into each engagement and therefore do not
        offer refunds once discovery has commenced.
      </p>
      <h2>Project cancellations</h2>
      <p>
        If you need to cancel before project kickoff, contact us at least 3 business days prior to the scheduled start for a
        full refund. After kickoff, any remaining credit is evaluated based on work completed.
      </p>
      <h2>Retainers</h2>
      <p>
        Retainer engagements are billed monthly. Cancel any upcoming month with 15 days written notice. Work already delivered
        is non-refundable.
      </p>
      <h2>Support</h2>
      <p>
        For billing or refund inquiries, email accounts@wedobrandz.com. We review every request to find the best resolution.
